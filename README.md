We will create a simple game that I called Flappy Bat (aka Flappy Bird).
The game purpose is to control a bat with a 'space' button, attempting to fly between columns of red pipes without hitting them. 
For this realization, I will use pygame (never used it before, but there are a lot of tutorials on which I will look via creating my own code). 
For referral I had https://github.com/clear-code-projects/FlappyBird_Python
Thank you

If you want to test a game:
1. Download all files to a folder on your computer
2. Make sure PyGame is installed.
3. Open flappy_bat.ipynb with jupyter notebook
4. Run all cells.
5. Play a game
